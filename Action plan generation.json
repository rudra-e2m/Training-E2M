Mandatory Backup & Staging Environment**\n- **Backup Critical Systems**:\n  - **Database**: Generate a full backup of the WordPress MySQL database via **`wp db backup`** (WP-CLI) or **phpMyAdmin** (if available).\n  - **File System**: Export a complete backup of the `/var/www/html/` directory (or equivalent) using **`tar -czvf panama_equity_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /var/www/html/`** (Linux) or **`zip -r panama_equity_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).zip /var/www/html/`** (Windows).\n  - **Server Configuration**: Backup **Nginx** (`/etc/nginx/`) and **PHP-FPM** (`/etc/php/`) configurations.\n  - **WooCommerce/Payment Gateways**: Verify no pending transactions or orders are in a failed state. Check **WooCommerce > Status > Logs** for errors.\n\n- **Staging Environment Validation**:\n  - Confirm a **staging replica** of the live site exists (e.g., `staging.panamaequity.com`).\n  - If staging is unavailable, **isolate the live environment** by:\n    - Placing the site in **maintenance mode** via **`wp maintenance-mode enable`** (WP-CLI) or **Elementor > Site Settings**.\n    - Disabling **WooCommerce** and **payment gateways** temporarily (if safe) via **`wp plugin deactivate woocommerce`** (WP-CLI) or **WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced**.\n  - **Access Requirements**:\n    - SSH access to the server with **`sudo`** privileges.\n    - **Cloudflare** (if used) API keys or dashboard access for rate-limit inspection.\n    - **New Relic**/**Datadog**/**AWS CloudWatch** (or equivalent) credentials for server metrics analysis.\n    - **WP-Admin** access with **`administrator`** role.\n    - **FTP/SFTP** credentials for file-level inspection.\n\n### **1.2. Environment Setup**\n- **Replicate Downtime Conditions**:\n  - Identify the **exact timestamps** of the downtime incidents from **server logs** (`/var/log/nginx/error.log`, `/var/log/nginx/access.log`, `/var/log/php-fpm.log`).\n  - Check **`top`**, **`htop`**, or **`glances`** (Linux) for peak CPU/memory usage during incidents.\n  - Review **`journalctl -u nginx --no-pager`** (Linux) for Nginx crashes or timeouts.\n- **Isolate Affected Components**:\n  - Disable **Elementor Pro** (if active) via **`wp plugin deactivate elementor-pro`** (WP-CLI) to rule out frontend-related resource spikes.\n  - Check **`wp cron event list`** (WP-CLI) for scheduled tasks that may coincide with downtime (e.g., **WooCommerce** syncs, **WPML** translations).\n  - Verify **`wp plugin list`** for resource-heavy plugins (e.g., **Revolution Slider**, **LayerSlider**, **WPML**, **Yoast SEO**, **WP Rocket**).\n\n---\n\n## **2. TECHNICAL EXECUTION STEPS**\n### **2.1. Server-Level Resource Analysis**\n- **Inspect Nginx & PHP-FPM**:\n  - Run **`nginx -t`** to validate configuration syntax.\n  - Check **`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`** and **`/etc/nginx/sites-available/panama_equity.conf`** (or equivalent) for:\n    - **Worker processes** (`worker_connections`): Ensure alignment with server CPU cores (e.g., `worker_processes 4;` for 4 cores).\n    - **Buffer sizes** (`fastcgi_buffer_size`, `proxy_buffer_size`): Increase if logs show `413 Request Entity Too Large` or `504 Gateway Timeout`.\n    - **Rate-limiting directives** (e.g., `limit_req_zone`, `limit_conn_zone`): Review and adjust if misconfigured.\n  - Analyze **PHP-FPM** pool settings (`/etc/php/8.x/fpm/pool.d/www.conf` or equivalent):\n    - **`pm.max_children`**: Ensure it’s set to **`2 * $cpu_cores + 1`** (e.g., `8` for a 4-core server).\n    - **`pm.start_servers`**, **`pm.min_spare_servers`**, **`pm.max_spare_servers`**: Validate against current traffic patterns.\n    - **`request_terminate_timeout`**: Increase from default `120s` to `300s` if slow requests are logged.\n  - **Check for Abnormal Loads**:\n    - Use **`netstat -tulnp`** (Linux) to identify open connections or ports under heavy load.\n    - Run **`ss -s`** to verify TCP/IP connection counts (e.g., `ESTAB` spikes).\n    - Inspect **`/var/log/auth.log`** for brute-force or DDoS attempts (e.g., `fail2ban` logs).\n\n- **Review Cloudflare (If Applicable)**:\n  - Navigate to **Cloudflare Dashboard > Security > Rate Limiting** and check for:\n    - **Firewall Rules** triggering blocks (e.g., `10000 requests per 1s`).\n    - **WAF Rules** causing false positives (e.g., `HTTP::Body` parsing delays).\n  - Temporarily **disable rate-limiting** to test if downtime recurs.\n  - Check **`Cloudflare Analytics > Traffic`** for sudden spikes in requests (e.g., **`HTTP Requests`**, **`Bandwidth`**).\n\n### **2.2. Application-Level Bottleneck Identification**\n- **WooCommerce & WPML Deep Dive**:\n  - **WooCommerce**:\n    - Run **`wp wc status`** (WP-CLI) to check for pending updates or conflicts.\n    - Enable **`WP_DEBUG`** and **`WP_DEBUG_LOG`** in `wp-config.php` to capture PHP errors during listing loads.\n    - Check **`WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > Log Level`** for **`debug`** mode.\n    - Review **`/wp-content/uploads/woocommerce_uploads/`** for large files (e.g., **`product_images`**, **`variation_images`**) causing upload delays.\n    - Validate **`shipping zone`** and **`tax rate`** calculations via **`WooCommerce > Status > Tools > Logs`** for slow queries.\n  - **WPML (WordPress Multilingual Plugin)**:\n    - Run **`wpml-st-status`** (WP-CLI) to check for **`string translation`** or **`post translation`** sync issues.\n    - Inspect **`WPML > Settings > Multilingual Content > Translation Management`** for **`automatic`** sync conflicts.\n    - Check **`WPML > Support > Troubleshooting`** for **`database cleanup`** recommendations.\n    - Review **`wpml_translation`** table size via **`phpMyAdmin`** or **`wp db query \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wpml_translation;\"`** (WP-CLI).\n\n- **Elementor & Frontend Optimization**:\n  - Disable **`Elementor > Experiments > Dynamic CSS`** to rule out CSS generation delays.\n  - Clear **`Elementor > Site Settings > Performance > CSS Cache`** and **`JS Cache`**.\n  - Check **`Elementor > System Info`** for **`PHP memory limit`** recommendations (e.g., increase from `256M` to `512M`).\n  - Review **`Elementor > Page Builder > Settings > Performance`** for:\n    - **`Load More`** (Lazy Load) settings.\n    - **`Archive Filtering`** (if listings are paginated).\n  - Audit **`Elementor > Theme Builder > Header/Footer`** for heavy scripts (e.g., **`custom JS`**, **`third-party integrations`**).\n\n### **2.3. Database & Query Optimization**\n- **Slow Query Analysis**:\n  - Run **`wp db query \"SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST;\"`** (WP-CLI) during peak hours to identify long-running queries.\n  - Check **`wp-config.php`** for **`WP_DEBUG`** and **`WP_DEBUG_LOG`** (set to `true`).\n  - Review **`/wp-content/debug.log`** for **`MySQL`** query timeouts (e.g., **`SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2006 MySQL server has gone away`**).\n  - Optimize **`wp_options`** table via **`wp db optimize`** (WP-CLI) or **`phpMyAdmin > Optimize Table`**.\n  - Run **`wp db repair`** (WP-CLI) if corruption is suspected.\n\n- **WooCommerce Database Fixes**:\n  - Rebuild **`WooCommerce`** indexes via **`WooCommerce > Status > Tools > Run Indexer`**.\n  - Check **`wp_woocommerce_sessions`** table for stale entries (e.g., **`DELETE FROM wp_woocommerce_sessions WHERE session_expiry < NOW();`**).\n  - Validate **`wp_woocommerce_order_items`**, **`wp_woocommerce_order_itemmeta`**, and **`wp_woocommerce_tax_rates`** for bloated data.\n\n### **2.4. Rate-Limit & API Throttling Review**\n- **Payment Gateway APIs**:\n  - Test **`WooCommerce > Settings > Payments`** for each gateway (e.g., **`Stripe`**, **`PayPal`**, **`Mercado Pago`**):\n    - Simulate **`100 concurrent transactions`** via **`WP REST API`** (e.g., **`/wp-json/wc/v3/orders`**) to check for **`429 Too Many Requests`**.\n    - Review **`WooCommerce > Status > Logs`** for **`API timeout`** or **`rate-limit exceeded`** errors.\n    - Adjust **`API request limits`** in gateway settings (e.g., **`Stripe > Webhooks > Rate Limit`**).\n  - If **`Mercado Pago`** is used, check **`MP > Settings > API > Request Throttling`** and increase limits.\n\n- **Third-Party API Integrations**:\n  - Audit **`WPML > Settings > Connected Sites`** for external API calls (e.g., **`Google Maps`**, **`translation services`**).\n  - Inspect **`Elementor > Page Builder > Settings > Custom Code`** for **`fetch()`** or **`axios`** calls to external APIs.\n  - Review **`/wp-content/plugins/`** for plugins with **`API rate-limit`** issues (e.g., **`Advanced Custom Fields`**, **`Gravity Forms`**).\n\n### **2.5. Configuration & Performance Tuning**\n- **Nginx Performance Adjustments**:\n  - Modify **`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`** to include:\n    ```nginx\n    http {\n      limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api_limit:10m rate=10r/s;\n      limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=conn_limit:10m;\n\n      server {\n        location /wp-json/ {\n          limit_req zone=api_limit burst=20 nodelay;\n          limit_conn conn_limit 10;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  - Test changes with **`nginx -t`** and reload via **`systemctl reload nginx`**.\n\n- **PHP-FPM & OpCache**:\n  - Update **`/etc/php/8.x/fpm/php.ini`** (adjust version as needed):\n    ```ini\n    opcache.enable=1\n    opcache.memory_consumption=256\n    opcache.interned_strings_buffer=128\n    opcache.max_accelerated_files=4000\n    opcache.revalidate_freq=60\n    opcache.fast_shutdown=1\n    ```\n  - Restart PHP-FPM: **`systemctl restart php8.x-fpm`**.\n\n- **WooCommerce & WPML Settings**:\n  - **WooCommerce**:\n    - Set **`WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > Force SSL`** to **`false`** (if mixed content is causing delays).\n    - Disable **`WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Shipping Calculations > Shipping Class`** if unused.\n  - **WPML**:\n    - Reduce **`WPML > Settings > Multilingual Content > Translation Management > Automatic`** sync frequency to **`hourly`**.\n    - Enable **`WPML > Settings > Multilingual Content > Translation Management > Cleanup`**.\n\n- **Database-Level Optimizations**:\n  - Increase **`MySQL`** **`innodb_buffer_pool_size`** to **`50% of available RAM`** (e.g., `4G` for 8GB server).\n  - Adjust **`wp-config.php`** for **`define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '512M');`** and **`define('WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT', '1024M');`**.\n\n---\n## **3.

POTENTIAL PITFALLS**\n### **4.1. Database Locking During Optimization**\n- **Risk**: Running **`REPAIR TABLE`** or **`OPTIMIZE TABLE`** on large WooCommerce/WPML tables may cause **`MySQL`** locks, leading to **`500 Internal Server Error`** for live users.\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Schedule optimizations during **`low-traffic hours`** (e.g., **`3 AM UTC`**).\n  - Use **`wp db optimize --run-on-schedule`** (WP-CLI) for gradual execution.\n  - Monitor **`InnoDB`** locks via **`SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;`** (WP-CLI).\n\n### **4.2. Cloudflare Rate-Limiting Misconfiguration**\n- **Risk**: Overly aggressive **`Cloudflare`** **`rate-limiting`** rules may block legitimate traffic (e.g., **`WooCommerce`** AJAX calls, **`WPML`** syncs).\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Whitelist **`WooCommerce`** and **`WPML`** IPs in **`Cloudflare > Firewall > IP Access Rules`**.\n  - Exclude **`/wp-json/`** and **`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`** from rate-limiting via **`Page Rules`**.\n  - Test with **`curl`** before re-enabling:\n    ```bash\n    curl -v -H \"CF-Ray: ^[0-9a-f]{20}\" https://panamaequity.com/wp-json/wc/v3/products\n    ```\n\n### **4.3. PHP-FPM Worker Process Starvation**\n- **Risk**: Setting **`pm.max_children`** too high may exhaust server memory, while setting it too low causes **`502 Bad Gateway`** errors under load.\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Start with **`pm.max_children = 2 * $cpu_cores + 1`** (e.g., `8` for 4 cores).\n  - Use **`pm.process_idle_timeout = 30s`**"

IMMEDIATE PREREQUISITES**\n### **Mandatory Backups & Environment Checks**\n- **Staging Environment Validation:**\n  - Confirm the staging site (`https://staging.nelson-exteriors.com/blog/guide-to-deck-installation-atlanta`) mirrors the live environment’s WordPress version (`6.6.x`), theme (`Astra Pro` or equivalent), and plugin configurations (`Elementor`, `WooCommerce`, `Smush`, etc.).\n  - Verify that all image assets (including alt text, captions, and file paths) are identical to the live post. Use **WP Media Library** or **FTP/SFTP** (e.g., FileZilla) to cross-check:\n    - Upload directory: `/wp-content/uploads/[year]/[month]/`\n    - Image dimensions: Ensure no unintended cropping/resizing (e.g., `1200x800px` for featured images, `600x400px` for inline).\n    - File formats: Confirm `.jpg`/`.png` with optimal compression (e.g., Smush settings: `80% quality`, `WebP conversion enabled`).\n\n- **Access Requirements:**\n  - **WordPress Admin:** Full editor access to the post (via `https://www.nelson-exteriors.com/wp-admin`).\n  - **Elementor Pro:** Ensure the post uses Elementor Pro (not Classic Editor) for image alignment/spacing checks.\n  - **Browser DevTools:** Chrome/Firefox/Edge with **Lighthouse** (for performance) and **Network Tab** (to inspect image loading).\n  - **Mobile Testing:** Physical devices or emulators (e.g., Chrome DevTools, BrowserStack) for iOS (Safari) and Android (Chrome).\n\n- **Dependencies:**\n  - **Nelson Exteriors Branding Guidelines:** Reconfirm image alignment (e.g., left-aligned for text-heavy sections, centered for hero images), padding (`20px`), and spacing (`30px` between paragraphs).\n  - **SEO Plugin (Yoast/AIOSEO):** Verify images are optimized for SEO (alt text matches context, file names are descriptive, e.g., `atlanta-deck-installation-step-1.jpg`).\n\n---\n\n## **2. TECHNICAL EXECUTION STEPS**\n### **Step 1: Visual & Structural Validation**\n- **Inspect Image Placement:**\n  - Open the live post in **Chrome DevTools (Elements Tab)** and validate:\n    - **Elementor Widgets:** Confirm images are embedded via **Elementor’s Image Widget** (not shortcodes or manual HTML).\n    - **Alignment:** Check CSS classes (e.g., `alignleft`, `aligncenter`, `wp-block-image`) or inline styles for consistency with branding guidelines.\n    - **Responsive Behavior:** Use **Lighthouse (Responsive Tab)** to simulate viewport sizes (e.g., `320px`, `768px`, `1024px`). Verify:\n      - No overflow issues (images stay within container bounds).\n      - `max-width: 100%` is applied to all image widgets.\n      - Mobile-specific media queries (e.g., `@media (max-width: 767px)`) adjust padding/margins as needed.\n\n- **Cross-Browser Testing:**\n  - Test in **Firefox (with Astra Pro theme default styles)** and **Safari (iOS)** to ensure:\n    - Font rendering doesn’t disrupt image alignment (e.g., `line-height: 1.5` in post content).\n    - No layout shifts due to differing default spacing (e.g., `margin-bottom: 24px` for paragraphs).\n\n### **Step 2: Performance & Load Optimization**\n- **Image Compression Audit:**\n  - Run **Lighthouse (Performance Tab)** on the live post to identify:\n    - **File Size:** Ensure images are < `200KB` (per Smush recommendations). Flag any exceeding `500KB`.\n    - **Lazy Loading:** Verify `loading=\"lazy\"` is applied to all images (check Elementor settings or `wp-block-image` attributes).\n    - **CDN Delivery:** Confirm images are served via **Cloudflare CDN** (or equivalent) with `CF-Cache-Status: HIT` in Network Tab.\n\n- **Critical Rendering Path Check:**\n  - Use **WebPageTest** ([https://www.webpagetest.org](https://www.webpagetest.org)) to analyze:\n    - **Above-the-Fold Images:** Ensure hero images load within **3 seconds** (TTFB + render time).\n    - **Non-Blocking Resources:** Validate no images block DOM construction (e.g., no inline `<img>` tags without `async`/`defer`).\n    - **Nginx/Server Logs:** Check for `404` errors on image paths (e.g., `/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/atlanta-deck-installation-step-1-500x300.jpg` vs. `/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/atlanta-deck-installation-step-1.jpg`).\n\n### **Step 3: SEO & Accessibility Compliance**\n- **Alt Text & Metadata:**\n  - Audit each image using **Yoast SEO’s Image Tab** or **AIOSEO**:\n    - Alt text must include **primary keyword** (e.g., \"deck installation Atlanta\") + descriptive context (e.g., \"wooden deck framing by Nelson Exteriors\").\n    - File names should avoid `IMG_1234.jpg`; use `atlanta-deck-installation-step-1.jpg`.\n    - Captions (if used) should be **concise** and **keyword-rich** (e.g., \"Step 1: Foundation Preparation for Atlanta Decks\").\n\n- **Structured Data Validation:**\n  - Use **Google’s Rich Results Test** ([https://search.google.com/test/rich-results](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)) to confirm:\n    - Images are included in `BlogPosting` schema (if applicable).\n    - No missing `image` properties in JSON-LD (e.g., `author`, `datePublished`, `mainEntityOfPage`).\n\n### **Step 4: Client Requirement Cross-Check**\n- **Reconfirm Branding Alignment:**\n  - Compare live post images against the **attached video** (December 09, 2025) and **Dropbox link**:\n    - [https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6tie2p62rd8zu59uj6pcp/Full-screen-December-09-2025-14-55-57.mp4?rlkey=e83rostxqyt8l0m19akgbl50v&dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6tie2p62rd8zu59uj6pcp/Full-screen-December-09-2025-14-55-57.mp4?rlkey=e83rostxqyt8l0m19akgbl50v&dl=0)\n  - Key checks:\n    - **Image Order:** Matches the logical sequence in the guide (e.g., installation → repair → rebuilding).\n    - **Visual Hierarchy:** Hero images (e.g., full-width deck) are prioritized over secondary images.\n    - **Consistency:** Same filter/color profile applied across all images (e.g., `Vibrant` or `Natural` in Smush).\n\n### **Step 5: Documentation & Handoff**\n- **Update Jira/Confluence:**\n  - Add a **QA Passed** label to the ticket with:\n    - Screenshots of DevTools validation (e.g., mobile responsiveness, alignment).\n    - Lighthouse/WebPageTest scores (e.g., `95/100` for Performance).\n    - Schema markup confirmation (JSON-LD snippet).\n  - Tag the client in Slack/Teams with:\n    > *\"QA completed for [post title]. All images validated for alignment, performance, and SEO. Live post mirrors staging: [URL]. Lighthouse scores: [X]/100. No issues identified.\"*\n\n---\n```\n\n**Note:** If the post uses a custom theme or non-Elementor image handling (e.g., manual HTML), replace Step 1 references with:\n- **Theme Files:** Inspect `/wp-content/themes/[theme-name]/single.php` or `/template-parts/content-single.php` for image markup.\n- **Custom CSS:** Check `/wp-content/themes/[theme-name]/custom.css` for `@media` overrides."

POTENTIAL PITFALLS**\n### **1. Form Script Conflicts (Download Our Free Guide Section)**\n- **Risk:** The pending form script may rely on legacy header/footer hooks or CSS classes.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - **Isolate Testing:** Complete header/footer updates **before** integrating the form script.\n  - **Conflict Audit:** Use **Chrome DevTools → Elements Panel** to check for overlapping classes (e.g., `.happytails-footer` vs. `.form-footer`).\n  - **Fallback Plan:** If conflicts arise, create a **page-specific template** for the form section and exclude it from global sync.\n\n### **2. Caching Delays (Favicon/Global Templates)**\n- **Risk:** CDN, browser, or plugin caches may delay visual updates post-deployment.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - **Pre-Purge:** Clear caches **before** deploying to production.\n  - **Hard Refresh:** Instruct stakeholders to use `Ctrl + F5` or private browsing mode.\n  - **Cache Plugins:** Disable **Elementor Experimental Features** and **W3 Total Cache** temporarily if issues persist.\n\n### **3. SVG Logo Security (Favicon/Headers)**\n- **Risk:** SVG files may contain malicious code if not sanitized.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - **Validate SVG:** Use [SVG Sanitizer](https://github.com/lukeapage/svg-sanitizer) or **Real Favicon Generator’s sanitizer**.\n  - **Restrict Uploads:** Set `wp-content/uploads/` permissions to **750** (owner: `www-data`, group: `www-data`):\n    ```bash\n    chmod -R 750 /wp-content/uploads/\n    chown -R www-data:www-data /wp-content/uploads/\n    ```\n\n---\n```"

IMMEDIATE PREREQUISITES**\n### **Access & Permissions**\n- **SSH Access:** Confirm read/write permissions to `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/` and `/wp-content/themes/[active-theme]/` directories.\n- **WP-Admin Credentials:** Ensure access to WooCommerce settings (`WooCommerce → Settings → Payments`).\n- **Stripe API Key:** Retrieve and securely store the **Live API Key** (for production) and **Test API Key** (for staging) in a password manager or environment variables (e.g., `.env` file or `wp-config.php`).\n- **Database Backup:** **Mandatory** – Create a full database backup via **WP-CLI** (`wp db export --path=/path/to/backup/`) or **phpMyAdmin** before proceeding.\n- **Staging Environment:** **Mandatory** – Deploy WooCommerce and Stripe integration to a staging site (e.g., `staging.example.com`) for thorough testing. Use a tool like **WP Staging** or **Duplicator** to replicate the live environment.\n- **HTTPS Verification:** Ensure the staging site has a valid SSL certificate (Stripe requires HTTPS for API calls).\n\n### **Environment Validation**\n- Verify WooCommerce version is **≥ 7.0** (latest stable) via `WooCommerce → Status`.\n- Check PHP version is **≥ 7.4** (Stripe PHP library requires PHP 7.4+).\n- Confirm `wp_remote_post()` and `curl` functions are enabled in PHP (`phpinfo()` or `wp-config.php`).\n- Disable caching plugins (e.g., **WP Rocket**, **W3 Total Cache**) or configure them to exclude `wp-admin` and `/checkout/` endpoints during testing.\n\n---\n\n## **2. TECHNICAL EXECUTION STEPS**\n### **Step 1: Install & Configure Stripe Plugin**\n1. **Plugin Installation:**\n   - Upload the latest **Stripe Payment Gateway for WooCommerce** plugin (v6.0+) via **WP-Admin** (`Plugins → Add New → Upload`) or **WP-CLI**:\n     ```bash\n     wp plugin install woocommerce-gateway-stripe --activate --path=/wp-content/plugins/\n     ```\n   - Verify plugin activation in `WooCommerce → Status → Plugins`.\n\n2. **API Key Setup:**\n   - Navigate to **WooCommerce → Settings → Payments → Stripe**.\n   - Enter the **Test API Key** (e.g., `pk_test_...`) for staging validation.\n   - Enable **\"Test Mode\"** to simulate transactions without live charges.\n   - Save settings.\n\n3. **Webhook Configuration:**\n   - Generate Stripe webhook signing secret via Stripe Dashboard (**Developers → Webhooks**).\n   - Add webhook endpoint in WooCommerce:\n     ```\n     https://staging.example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=stripe_webhook\n     ```\n   - Select events:\n     - `checkout.session.completed`\n     - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n     - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n     - `charge.disputed`\n   - Save and verify webhook delivery by triggering a test event in Stripe Dashboard.\n\n4. **Plugin Settings Validation:**\n   - Set **Currency** to match WooCommerce (`WooCommerce → Settings → General`).\n   - Configure **Allowed Countries** and **Payment Methods** (e.g., credit cards, SEPA, ACH) based on client requirements.\n   - Enable **\"Save Cards\"** if recurring payments or subscriptions are needed.\n   - Set **Default Payment Method** to Stripe if applicable.\n   - Disable other payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Cash on Delivery) temporarily for testing.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Customize Stripe Integration (If Required)**\n1. **Override Default Stripe Templates (Optional):**\n   - Copy Stripe template files from `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/templates/` to `/wp-content/themes/[active-theme]/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/` to avoid plugin updates overwriting customizations.\n   - Modify files like:\n     - `stripe-payment-form.php` (for checkout field styling).\n     - `stripe-payment-method.php` (for saved payment methods display).\n   - Use **WooCommerce hooks** (e.g., `woocommerce_stripe_form_fields`) for dynamic adjustments without direct template edits.\n\n2. **API Version & Compliance Checks:**\n   - Ensure Stripe PHP library is updated (`/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/vendor/stripe/stripe-php`).\n   - Validate compliance with **PCI DSS** requirements (Stripe handles tokenization, but ensure WooCommerce is configured to use Stripe’s hosted fields or Elements.js for sensitive data).\n\n3. **Inventory & Pricing Sync:**\n   - Verify WooCommerce **Stock Management** settings (`WooCommerce → Settings → Products → Inventory`) are enabled if real-time inventory updates are required.\n   - Test **Stripe Price ID** mapping (if using WooCommerce Subscriptions or custom products):\n     - Use `WC_Stripe_Product::sync_product_with_stripe()` to ensure product metadata (e.g., SKU, categories) aligns with Stripe’s `price` objects.\n     - Log discrepancies via `error_log()` in `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/includes/class-wc-stripe-product.php`.\n\n4. **SSH-Based Validation (Optional):**\n   - Check Stripe API logs in WooCommerce:\n     ```bash\n     grep \"stripe\" /wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/logs/woocommerce-stripe.log\n     ```\n   - Verify `wp_remote_post()` calls to Stripe endpoints (e.g., `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-stripe/includes/class-wc-stripe-api.php`).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Staging Environment Testing**\n1. **Test Mode Transactions:**\n   - Use Stripe’s **Test Cards** (e.g., `4242 4242 4242 4242` for success, `4000 0000 0000 0002` for failure) to simulate purchases.\n   - Verify:\n     - Checkout page loads correctly.\n     - Stripe Elements/Hosted Fields render without errors.\n     - Test webhook events trigger order status updates in WooCommerce.\n\n2. **Order Flow Validation:**\n   - Place a test order and confirm:\n     - **Order Status:** Changes from `Processing` to `Completed` (or `Failed` for test failures).\n     - **Stripe Dashboard:** Reflects the test transaction with correct metadata (e.g., product name, total amount).\n     - **WooCommerce Orders:** Displays Stripe payment details (e.g., transaction ID, payment method).\n\n3. **Error Handling:**\n   - Force API errors by:\n     - Temporarily disabling Stripe’s test API key.\n     - Entering an invalid test card (e.g., `4000 0000 0000 0001` for \"card declined\").\n   - Verify WooCommerce displays **user-friendly error messages** (e.g., \"Payment failed. Please try another method.\").\n   - Check Nginx/Apache error logs for `500` or `403` responses:\n     ```bash\n     tail -n 50 /var/log/nginx/error.log | grep \"stripe\"\n     # OR\n     grep \"stripe\" /var/log/apache2/error.log\n     ```\n\n4. **Performance Benchmarking:**\n   - Measure checkout page load time (critical for conversions) using **WebPageTest** or **GTmetrix**.\n   - Ensure Stripe’s JavaScript (`stripe.js`) loads asynchronously and doesn’t block rendering.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Live Environment Deployment (Post-QA)**\n1. **API Key Switch:**\n   - Replace **Test API Key** with **Live API Key** in `WooCommerce → Settings → Payments → Stripe`.\n   - Disable **\"Test Mode\"** and save settings.\n\n2. **Webhook Migration:**\n   - Recreate webhooks in Stripe Dashboard with the **Live API Key** and staging endpoint replaced with:\n     ```\n     https://live.example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=stripe_webhook\n     ```\n   - Verify webhook delivery by triggering a test event (e.g., `checkout.session.completed`) in Stripe Dashboard.\n\n3. **Post-Deployment Checks:**\n   - Confirm **PCI compliance** via Stripe Dashboard (**Settings → Compliance**).\n   - Monitor **WooCommerce → Status → Logs** for Stripe-related errors for **48 hours**.\n   - Validate **Nginx/Apache access logs** for successful Stripe API calls:\n     ```bash\n     grep \"api.stripe.com\" /var/log/nginx/access.log\n     ```\n\n4. **Client Handoff:**\n   - Provide a **README** with:\n     - Stripe Dashboard login credentials (if shared).\n     - Steps to **revert to test mode** (for future debugging).\n     - Contact details for support (e.g., Stripe’s [API Status Page](https://status.stripe.com/)).\n\n---\n\n## **3.

IMMEDIATE PREREQUISITES**\n### **Mandatory Backups & Environment Checks**\n- **Staging Environment Validation:**\n  - Confirm the staging site (`[STAGING_URL]`) is fully functional and mirrors production (plugins, themes, database, and server configuration).\n  - Verify domain redirection (if applicable) and SSL certificates are active in staging.\n  - Test WooCommerce (if used) with a sandbox payment gateway (e.g., Stripe Test Mode) to ensure transactional workflows are isolated.\n\n- **Production Environment Lockdown (if live updates are required):**\n  - **Backup Critical Assets:**\n    - Database: Use **WP-CLI** (`wp db export [DB_NAME].sql`) or **phpMyAdmin** to create a full backup of the production database.\n    - Files: Generate a **tar.gz** archive of `/wp-content/` via SSH (`tar -czvf wp-content-backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz /wp-content/`).\n    - **Mandatory:** Store backups in a secure, off-site location (e.g., AWS S3, Google Drive, or a dedicated backup server).\n\n  - **Server-Level Safeguards:**\n    - Disable **Elementor Cloud Sync** temporarily in production to prevent unintended sync conflicts.\n    - Set up **Nginx/Apache rate limiting** for staging/production to avoid accidental traffic spikes during testing.\n    - If using **WooCommerce**, disable live shipping rates via `wp-config.php`:\n      ```php\n      define('WC_SHIPPING_ENABLED', 'no');\n      ```\n\n- **Access & Permissions:**\n  - Obtain **SSH access** to the server for file modifications and log inspection.\n  - Ensure **WordPress Admin (WP-Admin)** credentials are available for staging/production.\n  - Request **Elementor Pro** license keys and **WooCommerce** API credentials (if applicable) from the client.\n  - Verify **Google Maps API** access (if location-based features are required) and **phone verification API** (e.g., Twilio) credentials.\n\n- **Tooling & Dependencies:**\n  - Install **Elementor Pro** (version `[X.X.X]`) and **Elementor Addons** (e.g., **Elementor Hello Theme**, **Elementor Kit**, **WooCommerce Builder**).\n  - Review **Project Brief** (Google Doc) for:\n    - Required **location-based widgets** (e.g., Google Maps, custom address fields).\n    - **Phone number display/validation** logic (e.g., static vs. dynamic, click-to-call, or API-driven).\n    - **WooCommerce** shipping zone requirements (if applicable).\n  - Watch **Loom Video** to confirm UI/UX expectations for location/phone integration.\n\n---\n\n## **2. TECHNICAL EXECUTION STEPS**\n### **Phase 1: Environment Setup & Configuration**\n1. **Clone & Deploy Staging Site:**\n   - Use **WP Staging** or **Duplicator** to clone the production site to staging.\n   - Validate deployment by:\n     - Checking `wp-config.php` for staging-specific constants (e.g., `WP_DEBUG`, `WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE`).\n     - Ensuring `.htaccess`/`nginx.conf` redirects are disabled in staging.\n\n2. **Install & Configure Required Plugins/Themes:**\n   - **Elementor Pro:**\n     - Activate **Elementor Hello Theme** (or equivalent) and set as default.\n     - Enable **Elementor Experiences** (if popups/location-based interactions are needed).\n   - **Location-Based Plugins:**\n     - Install **[Plugin Name]** (e.g., **Elementor Google Maps**, **WP GeoDirectory**, or **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) + ACF Google Maps Field]**).\n     - Configure API keys in plugin settings (e.g., `wp-admin/admin.php?page=acf-options` for ACF).\n     - Set up **geolocation services** (e.g., IP-based or browser-based via JavaScript).\n   - **Phone Integration Plugins:**\n     - Install **[Plugin Name]** (e.g., **WP Call Button**, **Twilio for WordPress**, or **ACF Phone Field + jQuery click-to-call**).\n     - Configure **Twilio API** (if used) in `wp-admin/admin.php?page=twilio-settings`:\n       ```php\n       // Example Twilio configuration (via plugin or custom code)\n       define('TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID', '[YOUR_SID]');\n       define('TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN', '[YOUR_TOKEN]');\n       define('TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER', '+[YOUR_NUMBER]');\n       ```\n   - **WooCommerce (if applicable):**\n     - Install **WooCommerce** and **WooCommerce Shipping & Tax** plugins.\n     - Update **shipping zone settings** (`WooCommerce → Settings → Shipping → Shipping Zones`) to include location-based logic (e.g., radius-based zones, geolocation plugins).\n     - Disable **real-time shipping rates** during development (see `wp-config.php` above).\n\n3. **Server-Side Adjustments:**\n   - **Nginx/Apache:**\n     - Modify `nginx.conf` or `.htaccess` to enforce **HTTP/2** for better performance:\n       ```nginx\n       # Example Nginx HTTP/2 configuration\n       server {\n           listen 443 ssl http2;\n           listen [::]:443 ssl http2;\n           server_name upside-therapy-staging.[DOMAIN];\n           ...\n       }\n       ```\n     - Ensure **gzip/brotli compression** is enabled for static assets (CSS/JS).\n   - **PHP & Database:**\n     - Update `wp-config.php` to include:\n       ```php\n       define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');\n       define('WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT', '512M');\n       ```\n     - Optimize database via **WP-Optimize** or **phpMyAdmin** (remove bloated tables, repair indexes).\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Development & Implementation**\n4. **Design Location-Based UI Components:**\n   - **Google Maps Integration:**\n     - Use **Elementor Pro’s Google Maps widget** or **ACF Google Maps Field** to embed maps.\n     - Customize via **Elementor’s Advanced Customizer**:\n       - Set `map_height`/`map_width` to responsive values (e.g., `400px` or `100vh`).\n       - Configure `zoom_level` (e.g., `14` for clinic-level precision).\n       - Add **custom markers** via `marker_icon` (SVG/URL) and **info windows** with `marker_content`.\n     - **Fallback for Non-JS Users:** Implement a static map image (e.g., via **Mapbox Static API**) in `functions.php`:\n       ```php\n       add_filter('elementor/google_maps/fallback_image', function() {\n           return 'https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/[STYLE_ID]/static/[LAT],[LNG]/[ZOOM]/[WIDTH]x[HEIGHT]?access_token=[TOKEN]';\n       });\n       ```\n   - **Dynamic Address Display:**\n     - Use **ACF** to store location data (e.g., `field_group` for clinic addresses).\n     - Create a **custom Elementor widget** (via **Elementor’s Theme Builder**) or use **ACF’s Dynamic Content** to pull addresses into pages.\n     - Example `functions.php` snippet for dynamic address:\n       ```php\n       add_action('elementor/widgets/widgets_registered', function() {\n           \\Elementor\\Widgets_Manager::instance()->register_widget_type(new \\Upside_Therapy\\Dynamic_Address_Widget());\n       });\n       ```\n     - Style address fields with **CSS Grid/Flexbox** for alignment (e.g., `display: grid;` in `style.css`).\n\n5. **Implement Phone Number Logic:**\n   - **Static Phone Display:**\n     - Add phone numbers via **Elementor’s Text Editor widget** or **ACF** (e.g., `field_name: clinic_phone`).\n     - Use **CSS pseudo-elements** to format phone numbers (e.g., `::before` for country codes):\n       ```css\n       .phone-number::before { content: \"+1 \"; }\n       ```\n   - **Click-to-Call Functionality:**\n     - Use **jQuery** in `custom.js` (or **Elementor’s Custom JS** section):\n       ```javascript\n       jQuery(document).ready(function($) {\n           $('.phone-link').on('click', function() {\n               window.location = 'tel:' + $(this).data('phone');\n           });\n       });\n       ```\n     - Example HTML structure:\n       ```html\n       <a href=\"tel:5551234567\" class=\"phone-link\" data-phone=\"5551234567\">Call Us</a>\n       ```\n   - **API-Driven Phone Validation (if required):**\n     - Integrate **Twilio Verify API** via `functions.php`:\n       ```php\n       // Example Twilio verification hook\n       add_action('wp_ajax_twilio_verify_phone', 'twilio_verify_phone_callback');\n       function twilio_verify_phone_callback() {\n           $phone = sanitize_text($_POST['phone']);\n           $service_sid = '[YOUR_SERVICE_SID]';\n           $verification = \\Twilio\\Rest\\Verify\\V2\\Service::verify($service_sid, $phone);\n           wp_send_json_success($verification);\n       }\n       ```\n     - Add a **custom Elementor form** with AJAX submission to trigger validation.\n\n6. **WooCommerce Shipping Zone Logic (if applicable):**\n   - **Geolocation-Based Shipping:**\n     - Use **WooCommerce Geolocation** plugin to auto-detect user location.\n     - Configure **shipping zones** with **radius-based rules** (e.g., 50-mile radius for local delivery).\n     - Set **default zone** in `functions.php`:\n       ```php\n       add_filter('woocommerce_shipping_location', function($location) {\n           return array(\n               'country' => 'US',\n               'state'   => 'CA',\n               'postcode'=> '90210',\n               'city'    => 'Los Angeles',\n               'address'  => '123 Main St'\n           );\n       });\n       ```\n   - **Dynamic Shipping Costs:**\n     - Use **ACF + WooCommerce Integration** to pull location data into shipping calculations.\n     - Example: Add a **custom field** (`clinic_shipping_cost`) to products and display it via `functions.php`:\n       ```php\n       add_action('woocommerce_product_options_shipping', 'add_clinic_shipping_field');\n       function add_clinic_shipping_field() {\n           woocommerce_wp_text_input(array(\n               'id' => '_clinic_shipping_cost',\n               'label' => __('Clinic Shipping Cost', 'woocommerce'),\n               'placeholder' => 'Enter cost (e.g., $10)',\n               'description' => __('Override standard shipping for clinic-based orders.', 'woocommerce')\n           ));\n       }\n       ```\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Testing & Optimization**\n7. **Staging Environment Validation:**\n   - **Location Accuracy Tests:**\n     - Use **Google Maps API’s Geocoding Service** to verify address parsing (e.g., `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=[ADDRESS]`).\n     - Test **IP-based geolocation** (if used) via tools like [IP2Location](https://www.ip2location.com/).\n   - **Phone Functionality Tests:**\n     - Verify **click-to-call** works on mobile/desktop (test in Chrome/Firefox/Safari).\n     - If using **Twilio Verify**, test with valid/invalid phone numbers to confirm API responses.\n   - **WooCommerce Shipping Tests:**\n     - Simulate orders from different locations (via **WooCommerce Shipping & Tax plugin’s test tools**).\n     - Validate **radius-based zones** and **dynamic cost overrides**.\n\n8. **Performance Optimization:**\n   - **Asset Loading:**\n     - Defer **non-critical JS** (e.g., Google Maps API) until after page load:\n       ```html\n       <script src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=[YOUR_KEY]&callback=initMap\" defer></script>\n       ```\n     - Lazy-load images with `loading=\"lazy\"` in Elementor’s **Image widget settings**.\n   - **Caching:**\n     - Configure **WP Rocket** or **LiteSpeed Cache** to exclude:\n       - `/wp-admin/` (admin pages).\n       - `/elementor/` (Elementor dynamic content).\n       - `/wc-api/` (WooCommerce API endpoints).\n     - Test **cache invalidation** for location/phone updates (e.g., purge cache after ACF changes).\n\n9. **Cross-Browser & Device Testing:**\n   - **Browsers:** Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest), Safari (latest), Edge.\n   - **Mobile:** Test Google Maps/phone interactions on iOS/Android (via **BrowserStack** or physical devices).\n   - **Responsive Design:**\n     - Validate **CSS media queries** for location/phone components:\n       ```css\n       /* Example: Adjust map on mobile */\n       @media (max-width: 767px) {\n           .elementor-widget-el-google-maps {\n               height: 300px !important;\n           }\n       }\n       ```\n     - Use **Elementor’s Responsive Controls** to test widget behavior at `1024px`, `768px`, and `480px` breakpoints.\n\n10. **Security & Compliance Checks:**\n    - **Phone Data:**\n      - Ensure **GDPR/CCPA compliance** if storing user phone numbers (e.g., use **ACF’s encrypted fields**).\n      -

IMMEDIATE PREREQUISITES**\n### **Mandatory Backups & Environment Validation**\n- **Staging Environment Requirement**:\n  - **Deploy to a staging site** (e.g., `staging.clubworks.com` or equivalent) **before any live modifications**.\n  - Ensure the staging site is a **full mirror** of the production environment (WordPress core, plugins, themes, database).\n  - Verify **child theme inheritance** (if using a parent theme like Astra, Divi, or similar) to avoid overwriting customizations.\n\n- **Access Requirements**:\n  - **SFTP/SSH access** to the WordPress installation directory (`/wp-content/`).\n  - **WP-Admin credentials** with `Theme Editor` and `Plugin Editor` permissions.\n  - **Theme files** (preferably a child theme) for custom CSS/HTML modifications.\n  - **Mockup PDF** reviewed for exact specifications (logo dimensions, spacing, typography, link behavior).\n\n- **Dependencies**:\n  - Confirm **Elementor Pro** (or equivalent page builder) is installed and activated for dynamic footer editing.\n  - Verify **WooCommerce** is not conflicting with footer placement (if applicable to the site structure).\n  - Check for existing **custom footer templates** or **static footer blocks** in the theme to avoid duplication.\n\n---\n\n## **2. TECHNICAL EXECUTION STEPS**\n### **Step 1: Footer Structure & Static Content Implementation**\n- **Option A (Elementor-Based)**:\n  - Navigate to **Elementor → Theme Builder → Footer**.\n  - Create a **new footer template** (e.g., `Footer_CompanyInfo`).\n  - Add a **Widget Area** or **HTML widget** to the template.\n  - Insert the following **static HTML** (adjust classes/IDs per theme requirements):\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"footer-company-info\" style=\"background-color: #1F2A4A; padding: 20px 0;\">\n      <div class=\"footer-content\">\n        <div class=\"footer-logo\">\n          <a href=\"https://clubworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n            <img src=\"[PATH_TO_CLUBWORKS_LOGO]\" alt=\"ClubWorks Logo\" width=\"[EXACT_WIDTH]\" height=\"[EXACT_HEIGHT]\">\n          </a>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"footer-companies\">\n          <ul>\n            <li><a href=\"https://peacockandlewis.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peacock & Lewis</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"https://www.jbd-jga.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JBD-JGA</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"https://ggapartners.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GGA Partners</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"https://www.privateclubfilms.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Private Club Films</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"https://clubworks.com/partner-firms/clubworks-engineering/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ClubWorks Engineering</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"https://buffalogroupe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buffalo Groupe</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"https://kdcarchitects.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KDC Architects</a></li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ```\n  - **Logo Handling**:\n    - Upload the **ClubWorks logo** to `/wp-content/uploads/` via **Media Library** (or use an existing file).\n    - Replace `[PATH_TO_CLUBWORKS_LOGO]` with the **full URL** (e.g., `https://clubworks.com/wp-content/uploads/logo.svg`).\n    - Set **exact dimensions** (e.g., `width=\"150\" height=\"50\"`) as per the mockup.\n\n- **Option B (Theme Files Direct Edit)**:\n  - Locate the **footer template file** (e.g., `/wp-content/themes/[THEME_NAME]/footer.php`).\n  - **Modify the file** to include the static HTML block above **before** `<?php get_footer(); ?>`.\n  - **Add inline CSS** for background color (`#1F2A4A`) and padding, or reference a **custom CSS class** in the theme’s `style.css`.\n\n### **Step 2: Typography & Styling Configuration**\n- **Font Family**:\n  - Add the following **CSS snippet** to **Appearance → Customize → Additional CSS** (or `/wp-content/themes/[THEME_NAME]/style.css` if using a child theme):\n    ```css\n    .footer-company-info .footer-logo img,\n    .footer-company-info .footer-companies ul li a {\n      font-family: '[REQUIRED_FONT_FAMILY]'; /* e.g., 'Arial, sans-serif' or 'Roboto' */\n    }\n    ```\n  - Replace `[REQUIRED_FONT_FAMILY]` with the **exact font family** specified in the mockup (e.g., `'Montserrat', sans-serif`).\n  - If using **Google Fonts**, ensure the font is **enqueued** in the theme’s `functions.php`:\n    ```php\n    function clubworks_footer_fonts() {\n      wp_enqueue_style('clubworks-footer-fonts', 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@400;500&display=swap');\n    }\n    add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'clubworks_footer_fonts');\n    ```\n\n- **Link Styling**:\n  - Add CSS to ensure links match the mockup (e.g., hover effects, underline behavior):\n    ```css\n    .footer-company-info .footer-companies ul li a {\n      color: #FFFFFF; /* or specified link color */\n      text-decoration: none; /* or 'underline' if required */\n      transition: color 0.3s ease;\n    }\n    .footer-company-info .footer-companies ul li a:hover {\n      color: #A0B3E0; /* hover color */\n      text-decoration: underline;\n    }\n    ```\n\n- **Logo Alignment**:\n  - Use **Flexbox** or **Grid** to align logo and company list per mockup:\n    ```css\n    .footer-content {\n      display: flex;\n      justify-content: space-between;\n      align-items: center;\n      max-width: 1200px;\n      margin: 0 auto;\n      padding: 0 20px;\n    }\n    .footer-companies ul {\n      list-style: none;\n      padding: 0;\n      display: flex;\n      flex-wrap: wrap;\n      gap: 15px;\n    }\n    ```\n\n### **Step 3: Responsive Media Queries & Device Testing**\n- **Mobile Responsiveness**:\n  - Modify the CSS to stack logo and companies vertically on small screens (e.g., `<768px`):\n    ```css\n    @media (max-width: 767px) {\n      .footer-content {\n        flex-direction: column;\n        gap: 15px;\n      }\n      .footer-companies ul {\n        flex-direction: column;\n        text-align: center;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  - Adjust **logo dimensions** and **padding** for mobile (e.g., `width=\"100\"`).\n\n- **Tablet Adjustments** (if needed):\n  - Add a **media query for tablets** (e.g., `768px–991px`) to fine-tune spacing.\n\n### **Step 4: WooCommerce & Plugin Conflict Resolution (If Applicable)**\n- **Check for Overrides**:\n  - If the site uses **WooCommerce**, inspect `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/` for custom footer files.\n  - Disable **conflicting plugins** (e.g., custom footer plugins) temporarily to test footer behavior.\n  - Clear **WooCommerce transients** (`wp_options` table) if shipping/payment-related footer conflicts exist:\n    ```sql\n    DELETE FROM wp_options WHERE option_name LIKE '%woocommerce_%';\n    ```\n\n### **Step 5: Deployment to Production**\n- **Staging Validation**:\n  - Test the footer **across all major browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (mobile/desktop/tablet).\n  - Verify **no 404 errors** for logo or company links (use **Browser DevTools → Network tab**).\n  - Check **load performance** (footer should not impact page speed; optimize images if needed).\n\n- **Live Site Deployment**:\n  - **Push changes to production** via **Git (preferred)** or **manual SFTP upload** (only if Git is unavailable).\n  - **Update theme files** in `/wp-content/themes/[THEME_NAME]/` (or child theme).\n  - **Clear all caches**:\n    - WordPress cache (e.g., WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache).\n    - Browser cache (hard refresh or incognito mode).\n    - CDN cache (e.g., Cloudflare, if used).\n  - **Re-enable plugins** and test for conflicts.\n\n---\n## **3.

POTENTIAL PITFALLS**\n1. **Theme Updates Overwriting Customizations**:\n   - If using a **child theme**, ensure all modifications are in the child theme’s files (not the parent).\n   - **Risk**: Parent theme updates may revert footer changes.\n   - **Mitigation**:\n     - Document all customizations in `README.md` within the child theme.\n     - Use **Elementor Theme Builder** (Option A) to avoid direct file edits.\n\n2. **Caching Delays**:\n   - **Risk**: Browser/CDN/WordPress caches may delay footer visibility post-deployment.\n   - **Mitigation**:\n     - **Clear caches manually** before testing.\n     - Add a **cache-busting query** to logo/image URLs if static caching is suspected:\n       ```html\n       <img src=\"[LOGO_URL]?v=2.1\" alt=\"ClubWorks Logo\">\n       ```\n\n3. **WooCommerce Footer Conflicts**:\n   - **Risk**: WooCommerce may inject its own footer content, overriding or duplicating the custom footer.\n   - **Mitigation**:\n     - Use **Elementor’s WooCommerce integration** to ensure footer placement priority.\n     - Disable WooCommerce’s default footer via:\n       ```php\n       add_filter('woocommerce_footer_html', '__return_empty_string');\n       ```\n\n4. **Mobile Logo Scaling Issues**:\n   - **Risk**: Logo may appear too large/small on mobile devices.\n   - **Mitigation**:\n     - Test **exact logo dimensions** on mobile (use `max-width: 100%` in CSS if needed).\n     - Ensure **SVG/PNG** format is used (avoid JPG for logos).\n\n---\n## **5. POST-TASK HANDOFF**\n- **Documentation**:\n  - Update the **mockup PDF** with a screenshot of the live implementation.\n  - Add a **code snippet** to the project’s `docs/` folder for future reference.\n- **Rollback Plan**:\n  - Provide a **Git revert command** or **SFTP backup instructions** for quick rollback if issues arise.\n- **Monitoring**:\n  - Set up **UptimeRobot** alerts for the footer section (if critical).\n  - Log **Nginx/Apache access errors** for 48 hours post-deployment.\n```\n\n---\n**Note**: Replace placeholders (e.g., `[THEME_NAME]`, `[REQUIRED_FONT_FAMILY]`) with actual values from the project. Adjust steps based on whether the site uses a **page builder (Elementor)** or **direct theme edits**."

IMMEDIATE PREREQUISITES**\n### **Mandatory Backups & Environment Validation**\n- **Staging Environment Requirement**:\n  - Deploy the task to a **staging site** (e.g., `staging.example.com`) that mirrors the live production environment (`example.com`).\n  - Confirm the staging site is **fully isolated** (no direct user traffic, no impact on live sales or SEO).\n  - Verify **WordPress version**, **PHP version**, and **theme/plugin compatibility** (e.g., Astra, Divi, or custom theme) via `wp-cli --info` or WP-Admin → **Dashboard → Server Info**.\n\n- **Theme & Asset Access**:\n  - Obtain **read/write access** to the theme’s `/templates/`, `/includes/`, and `/assets/` directories via **SFTP/SSH** or **WP-Admin → Appearance → Theme File Editor**.\n  - Ensure **existing theme color scheme** (e.g., CSS variables, SASS maps, or hardcoded hex/RGB values) is documented. If undocumented, extract via:\n    - **DevTools (Chrome/Firefox)** → Inspect elements → Check computed styles for `background-color`, `color`, `border-color`, etc.\n    - **Theme’s `style.css`** or **customizer settings** (`/wp-admin/customize.php`).\n  - Validate **image optimization tools** (e.g., ShortPixel, Imagify, or Smush) are active and configured for the staging site.\n\n- **Dependencies**:\n  - Confirm **Elementor Pro** (or equivalent page builder) is installed and activated on the staging site.\n  - Check for **slider plugins** (e.g., MetaSlider, Soliloquy, or Elementor’s native slider) and ensure compatibility with the theme.\n  - If using **WooCommerce**, verify the staging site has the same **shipping zones, payment gateways, and cart settings** as production.\n\n---\n\n## **2. TECHNICAL EXECUTION STEPS**\n### **Step 1: Design System & Color Scheme Integration**\n- **Extract Existing Palette**:\n  - Run `grep -r \"color:\" /path/to/theme/assets/` to identify hardcoded colors in CSS/JS.\n  - Document all **primary/secondary colors**, **text hues**, and **button states** (e.g., `:hover`, `:active`) in a **design system spec** (e.g., Figma/Adobe XD).\n- **Define Hero Section Colors**:\n  - Align hero text, subheading, and CTA button colors with the theme’s palette.\n  - Example (if palette uses CSS variables):\n    ```css\n    :root {\n      --hero-text-color: #ffffff; /* Extracted from theme */\n      --hero-bg-color: #2a2a2a; /* Extracted from theme */\n      --cta-button-primary: #ff6b6b; /* Extracted from theme */\n      --cta-button-secondary: #4ecdc4; /* Extracted from theme */\n    }\n    ```\n- **Create Design Mockups**:\n  - Generate **responsive wireframes** (desktop, tablet, mobile) for the hero section using tools like **Figma**, **Sketch**, or **Penpot**.\n  - Specify **breakpoints** (e.g., `768px`, `1024px`) and **adaptive layout rules** (e.g., text size, padding adjustments).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Implement Background Image Slider (Performance-Optimized)**\n- **Option A: Elementor Native Slider (Recommended for Simplicity)**\n  - **Add Slider Widget**:\n    - Navigate to **Elementor → Edit Homepage** → Drag **\"Slider\"** widget into the hero section container.\n    - Configure slider settings:\n      - **Loop**: Disabled (unless client requires it).\n      - **Autoplay**: Enabled with **30s delay** (adjustable via `elementor-slider-settings`).\n      - **Transition**: **Fade** (smoother than slide; reduce motion blur).\n      - **Pause on Hover**: Enabled (improves UX for mobile).\n  - **Optimize Slide Images**:\n    - Upload **WebP-compressed** versions of hero images (e.g., `hero-slide-1.webp`, `hero-slide-2.webp`).\n    - Set **max dimensions** (e.g., `1920x1080px`) and **quality** (e.g., `80%`) via **Media Library → Bulk Edit**.\n    - Implement **lazy loading** for slider images:\n      ```html\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"slide-1.webp\" alt=\"Hero Slide 1\" class=\"elementor-slide\">\n      ```\n    - Use **CSS `object-fit: cover`** to maintain aspect ratio without stretching:\n      ```css\n      .elementor-slide img {\n        object-fit: cover;\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 100%;\n      }\n      ```\n  - **Slider Container Styling**:\n    - Modify the slider container’s **CSS** to ensure full-width responsiveness:\n      ```css\n      .elementor-slider-container {\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 60vh; /* Adjust based on design */\n        min-height: 400px; /* Fallback for mobile */\n        margin: 0;\n        padding: 0;\n      }\n      ```\n    - Override **default slider arrows** (if needed) via:\n      ```css\n      .elementor-slider .elementor-slider-pagination,\n      .elementor-slider .elementor-slider-arrows {\n        display: none !important;\n      }\n      ```\n\n- **Option B: Custom Slider (Advanced, e.g., Swiper.js)**\n  - **Install Swiper.js**:\n    - Add via **npm** (`npm install swiper`) or **direct CDN** in `functions.php`:\n      ```php\n      function enqueue_swiper() {\n        wp_enqueue_script('swiper-bundle', 'https://unpkg.com/swiper@8/swiper-bundle.min.js', [], null, true);\n        wp_enqueue_style('swiper-css', 'https://unpkg.com/swiper@8/swiper-bundle.min.css');\n      }\n      add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'enqueue_swiper');\n      ```\n  - **Create Custom Slider HTML/JS**:\n    - Add slider markup in `/templates/hero-section.php`:\n      ```html\n      <div class=\"hero-slider swiper\">\n        <div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n          <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n            <img src=\"<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/images/hero-slide-1.webp\" alt=\"Slide 1\" class=\"hero-slide-img\">\n            <div class=\"hero-slide-content\">\n              <h1 class=\"hero-slide-headline\"><?php echo esc_html(get_theme_mod('hero_headline')); ?></h1>\n              <p class=\"hero-slide-subheading\"><?php echo esc_html(get_theme_mod('hero_subheading')); ?></p>\n              <div class=\"hero-slide-cta\">\n                <a href=\"<?php echo esc_url(get_theme_mod('hero_cta_url')); ?>\" class=\"button-primary\"><?php echo esc_html(get_theme_mod('hero_cta_text')); ?></a>\n                <a href=\"<?php echo esc_url(get_theme_mod('hero_secondary_cta_url')); ?>\" class=\"button-secondary\"><?php echo esc_html(get_theme_mod('hero_secondary_cta_text')); ?></a>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <!-- Repeat for additional slides -->\n        </div>\n        <!-- Add pagination/navigation if required -->\n      </div>\n      ```\n    - Initialize Swiper in `/assets/js/hero-slider.js`:\n      ```js\n      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n        const heroSlider = new Swiper('.hero-slider', {\n          loop: false,\n          autoplay: {\n            delay: 30000,\n            disableOnInteraction: false,\n          },\n          pagination: {\n            el: '.swiper-pagination',\n            clickable: true,\n          },\n          navigation: {\n            nextEl: '.swiper-button-next',\n            prevEl: '.swiper-button-prev',\n          },\n          lazy: true,\n          effect: 'fade',\n          fadeEffect: {\n            crossFade: true,\n          },\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n  - **Performance Optimizations**:\n    - Enable **Swiper’s lazy loading** for images/videos.\n    - Set **preload slides** to `1` (balance between performance and UX):\n      ```js\n      preloadImages: true,\n      lazyPreloadPrevNext: 1,\n      ```\n    - Use **CSS `will-change: transform`** for smoother transitions:\n      ```css\n      .hero-slider .swiper-slide {\n        will-change: transform;\n      }\n      ```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Responsive Layout & Breakpoint Adjustments**\n- **CSS Media Queries**:\n  - Modify `/assets/css/hero-section-responsive.css` (or theme’s `style.css`) to add breakpoints:\n    ```css\n    /* Tablet (768px) */\n    @media (max-width: 768px) {\n      .hero-slider {\n        height: 50vh;\n      }\n      .hero-slide-headline {\n        font-size: 2.5rem;\n        line-height: 1.2;\n      }\n      .hero-slide-subheading {\n        font-size: 1.2rem;\n        max-width: 80%;\n      }\n      .hero-slide-cta {\n        flex-direction: column;\n        gap: 1rem;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /* Mobile (480px) */\n    @media (max-width: 480px) {\n      .hero-slider {\n        height: 40vh;\n      }\n      .hero-slide-headline {\n        font-size: 2rem;\n      }\n      .hero-slide-subheading {\n        font-size: 1rem;\n      }\n      .hero-slide-cta .button-primary,\n      .hero-slide-cta .button-secondary {\n        width: 100%;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n- **Elementor Responsive Controls**:\n  - If using Elementor, adjust **widget-level responsiveness** for:\n    - **Headline text**: Reduce font size to `2rem` on mobile.\n    - **Subheading**: Set `max-width: 80%` on tablet/mobile.\n    - **CTA buttons**: Stack vertically on mobile (`flex-direction: column`).\n    - **Slider height**: Scale proportionally (e.g., `60vh` → `50vh` → `40vh`).\n\n- **Viewport Meta Tag**:\n  - Ensure `/header.php` includes:\n    ```html\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Load Optimization & Asset Management**\n- **Critical CSS Inlining**:\n  - Use **Autoptimize** or **WP Rocket** to inline **critical CSS** for the hero section (reduce render-blocking).\n  - Alternatively, manually extract hero-specific CSS via **Penthouse** or **Critical Path CSS Generator**.\n\n- **Image CDN & Caching**:\n  - Configure **Cloudflare** or **Imagify CDN** to serve slider images with:\n    - **WebP conversion** (fallback to JPEG/PNG).\n    - **Cache TTL**: `1 week` (balance between freshness and performance).\n    - **Responsive images**: Ensure `srcset` is generated for all slider images.\n\n- **Slider Preloading**:\n  - Preload the first slider image in `/header.php`:\n    ```php\n    function preload_hero_slider() {\n      echo '<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"' . get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/images/hero-slide-1.webp\" as=\"image\" fetchpriority=\"high\">';\n    }\n    add_action('wp_head', 'preload_hero_slider');\n    ```\n\n- **Lazy-Load Non-Critical JS**:\n  - Defer Swiper.js (or Elementor slider scripts) via:\n    ```php\n    function defer_swiper_script() {\n      if (is_page('home')) {\n        wp_add_inline_script('swiper-bundle', 'initSwiper();', 'deferred');\n      }\n    }\n    add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'defer_swiper_script');\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Cross-Browser & Device Testing (Staging)**\n- **BrowserStack/LambdaTest**:\n  - Test hero section on:\n    - **Desktop**: Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest), Safari (latest), Edge.\n    - **Tablet**: iPad Pro (iOS), Samsung Tab (Android).\n    - **Mobile**: iPhone 13 (iOS), Pixel 6 (Android), Galaxy S22 (Android).\n  - Verify:\n    - **Slider transitions** are smooth (no jank).\n    - **Text alignment** (e.g., `text-align: center`) is consistent.\n    - **CTA buttons** are touch-friendly on mobile (min `48x48px` padding).\n\n- **Lighthouse Audit**:\n  - Run **Google Lighthouse** (via Chrome DevTools or `npm install lighthouse`) on staging to check:\n    - **Performance**: Ensure **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** is `< 2.5s` (slider images should load within budget).\n    - **Accessibility**: Verify **color contrast** (e.g., hero text on dark background) meets **WCAG AA**.\n    - **Best Practices**: No mixed content warnings, proper `alt` text for images.\n\n- **GTmetrix/Pingdom**:\n  - Confirm **total page load time** is within acceptable thresholds (e.g., `< 3s`).\n  - Check **slider-specific metrics**:\n    - **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**: `< 500ms` (server response time).\n    - **Image compression savings**: `> 50%` reduction from originals.\n\n---\n\n## **3.

POTENTIAL PITFALLS**\n### **1. Render-Blocking Critical Resources**\n- **Risk**: Unoptimized CSS/JS for the slider may delay **LCP**, hurting SEO and UX.\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Use **Autoptimize** or **WP Rocket** to inline critical CSS.\n  - Defer non-critical JS (e.g., Swiper initialization) until after DOM load.\n  - Test with **Lighthouse → Performance** to confirm no render-blocking issues.\n\n### **2. Inconsistent Theme Color Palette**\n- **Risk**: Undocumented or conflicting color values may result in visual mismatches.\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - **Audit all theme files** (`grep -r \"#hex\" /path/to/theme/`) to centralize color usage.\n  - If using **CSS variables**, ensure they’re defined in `/assets/css/variables.css` and imported globally.\n  - Validate colors via **DevTools → Computed Styles** at each breakpoint.\n\n### **3. Mobile Touch Target Failures**\n- **Risk**: CTA buttons or slider controls may be too small for mobile users (violates WCAG).\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Enforce **min `48x48px` touch targets** via CSS:\n    ```css\n    .hero-slide-cta a {\n      min-width: 144px;\n      min-height: 48px;\n      padding: 12px 24px;\n    }\n    ```\n  - Test with **BrowserStack → Mobile Devices** or **real devices**.\n\n### **4. Slider Plugin Conflicts**\n- **Risk**: Third-party slider plugins (e.g., MetaSlider) may conflict with theme/Elementor.\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - **Test in staging first** with all plugins activated.\n  - If using **Elementor native slider**, disable other"

IMMEDIATE PREREQUISITES**\n### **1.1. Access & Permissions**\n- **Mandatory:** SSH access to the server with `sudo` privileges.\n- **Mandatory:** Access to the CMS (WordPress) admin dashboard (`wp-admin`).\n- **Mandatory:** Access to the following plugins/themes:\n  - **Elementor Pro** (if used for page layouts).\n  - **WooCommerce** (if e-commerce pages are affected).\n  - **Custom theme** (if not using a page builder).\n  - **CSS preprocessor tools** (Sass/Less if applicable).\n- **Mandatory:** Browser DevTools (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) for emulation and debugging.\n- **Mandatory:** Mobile/tablet devices (iOS/Android) for manual testing.\n\n### **1.2. Backup & Staging Environment**\n- **⚠️ MANDATORY WARNING:**\n  - **Live Site:** If this task involves a live production environment, **immediately create a full backup** (database + files) using:\n    ```bash\n    wp db export --path=/var/www/html/wp-content/uploads/backup/ full_backup.sql\n    rsync -avz --delete /var/www/html/ /var/www/html/backup/\n    ```\n  - **Staging Site:** If a staging environment exists, **validate the current state** against the live site to ensure parity. If not, **deploy a duplicate of the live environment** to staging for testing.\n  - **Version Control:** Ensure all critical files (e.g., `style.css`, `theme.php`, WooCommerce plugins) are committed to Git (or equivalent) before making changes.\n\n### **1.3. Tooling & Dependencies**\n- **Verify:** Ensure `Autoptimize` or similar caching plugins are **disabled** during testing to avoid stale CSS/JS.\n- **Verify:** Confirm no active **CSS/JS minification** is occurring (may obscure debugging).\n- **Verify:** Check for **third-party integrations** (e.g., payment gateways, analytics) that may inject custom CSS/JS.\n\n---\n\n## **2. TECHNICAL EXECUTION STEPS**\n### **2.1. Audit Current Mobile/Tablet Layouts**\n- **Action:** Use **Browser DevTools** (Chrome: `Ctrl+Shift+M` or `F12 > Device Toolbar`) to test the following breakpoints:\n  - **Mobile:** `320px–767px` (iPhone SE, iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21).\n  - **Tablet:** `768px–1023px` (iPad Mini, iPad Pro, Samsung Tab S7).\n- **Focus Areas:**\n  - **Overlapping Elements:** Inspect `position`, `z-index`, and `flexbox/grid` properties in `style.css`, `theme.php`, and custom CSS snippets.\n  - **Font Scaling:** Check `em`/`rem` units vs. `px` in typography rules (e.g., `body`, `.elementor-heading`, WooCommerce product titles).\n  - **Button/Link Spacing:** Validate `padding`, `margin`, and `touch-action` (e.g., `.elementor-button`, `.woocommerce button`).\n  - **Grid Systems:** Audit `container queries` (if supported), `@media` rules, and `max-width` constraints in:\n    - **Elementor:** `Customizer > Theme Builder > Global Settings > Responsive`.\n    - **WooCommerce:** `Settings > Shipping > Shipping Zones` (for mobile-specific overrides).\n    - **Custom Theme:** `assets/css/style.css`, `assets/css/responsive.css`, or theme-specific media query files.\n- **Tools:**\n  - **Lighthouse CI:** Run automated audits for `responsive design` and `accessibility` (mobile emulation).\n  - **CSS Coverage:** Use `Chrome DevTools > Coverage` to identify unused media queries.\n\n### **2.2. Implement Fixes**\n#### **2.2.1. CSS & Theme Adjustments**\n- **Modify Media Queries:**\n  - **Target Files:** `style.css`, `theme.php`, or Elementor’s `global-responsive.css` (if applicable).\n  - **Actions:**\n    - Replace `px`-based fixed widths with `max-width` + `vw`/`vh` units for fluid containers.\n    - Adjust `flex-direction` and `grid-template-columns` for tablet/mobile views (e.g., switch from `grid` to `column` for `768px`).\n    - Override `!important` declarations in custom CSS if they conflict with responsive rules.\n    - Example:\n      ```css\n      /* Before (fixed width) */\n      .product-grid { width: 1000px; }\n\n      /* After (responsive) */\n      .product-grid {\n        width: 100%;\n        max-width: 1024px;\n      }\n\n      @media (max-width: 768px) {\n        .product-grid { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }\n      }\n      ```\n- **Touch Target Validation:**\n  - Ensure all interactive elements (`buttons`, `links`, `form inputs`) meet **WCAG 2.1** standards (≥ `48x48px`).\n  - Add `touch-action: manipulation;` to prevent accidental zooming/panning on touch elements.\n  - Example:\n    ```css\n    .elementor-button, .woocommerce button {\n      min-height: 48px;\n      min-width: 48px;\n      touch-action: manipulation;\n    }\n    ```\n\n#### **2.2.2. WooCommerce-Specific Fixes**\n- **Action:** If e-commerce pages are affected:\n  - **Update Shipping Zones:** Navigate to `WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Shipping Zones` and validate mobile/tablet-specific overrides.\n  - **Modify Product Layout:**\n    - Adjust `WC_Product::get_price_html()` output for mobile (e.g., force single-column pricing tables).\n    - Override `woocommerce/archive-product.php` template if needed (copy to child theme first).\n  - **Fix Cart/Checkout:**\n    - Ensure `woocommerce/cart/cart-totals.php` and `woocommerce/checkout/form-shipping.php` use responsive tables or stacked layouts.\n    - Validate `input[type=\"submit\"]` and `input[type=\"radio\"]` touch targets.\n\n#### **2.2.3. JavaScript & Dynamic Content**\n- **Action:** If issues persist with dynamic content (e.g., sliders, tabs):\n  - **Inspect JS:** Check `console.log()` for errors in `window.matchMedia()` or responsive JS hooks.\n  - **Modify Breakpoints:** Update JS-based responsive logic (e.g., in `theme.js`, `elementor-frontend.js`) to align with CSS.\n  - **Example:**\n    ```javascript\n    // In theme.js or custom JS\n    if (window.matchMedia('(max-width: 768px)').matches) {\n      document.querySelector('.dynamic-element').style.flexDirection = 'column';\n    }\n    ```\n\n### **2.3. Test & Validate Changes**\n- **Action:** Deploy fixes to the **staging environment** first (or use a local dev site with `wp-env`).\n- **Tools:**\n  - **BrowserStack:** Test across real devices (iOS/Android) and browsers (Safari, Chrome for Android).\n  - **LambdaTest:** Cross-device automation for regression checks.\n- **Manual Testing:**\n  - Navigate through all **major pages** (Home, Shop, Product, Cart, Checkout, Account, Blog, Contact).\n  - Verify **no horizontal scrolling** is required on any viewport.\n  - Check **font readability** (avoid sub-`14px` text without scaling).\n  - Confirm **touch targets** are accessible (no double-taps needed).\n\n### **2.4. Performance Optimization**\n- **Action:** Post-fix, optimize responsive assets:\n  - **Lazy-Load Images:** Ensure `loading=\"lazy\"` is set on `<img>` tags in mobile views.\n  - **Compress CSS:** Use `Autoptimize` or `WP Rocket` to combine/minify responsive CSS (re-enable post-testing).\n  - **Critical CSS:** Generate mobile-specific critical CSS to reduce render-blocking (tools: `Critical CSS`, `Above the Fold`).\n  - **Example Nginx Optimization (if applicable):**\n    ```nginx\n    # Add mobile-specific cache rules in nginx.conf\n    map $http_accept $mobile_accept {\n      default 0;\n      \"~*text/html\" 1;\n    }\n\n    server {\n      location / {\n        add_header X-Responsive-Cache \"mobile\" if $mobile_accept;\n        proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx/mobile levels=1:2 keys_zone=mobile:10m inactive=60m use_temp_path=off;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n### **2.5. Documentation & Handoff**\n- **Action:** Document all changes in:\n  - **Git Commit Messages:** Reference breakpoints fixed (e.g., `FIX: Tablet grid overlap at 768px`).\n  - **README.md:** Add a \"Responsive Fixes\" section with:\n    - Before/after screenshots (use `Firefox Responsive Design Mode`).\n    - List of modified files (e.g., `style.css`, `woocommerce/archive-product.php`).\n    - Known limitations (e.g., \"iPad Pro 12.9\" requires manual zoom for some text).\n- **Handoff to QA/DevOps:**\n  - Provide **staging URL** for final review.\n  - Flag any **third-party dependencies** (e.g., payment gateways) that may need re-testing.\n\n---\n\n## **3. QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA) CHECKLIST**\n### **3.1. Visual & Functional Validation**\n| **Test**                          | **Tool/Method**                          | **Pass/Fail Criteria**                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| No overlapping elements on mobile/tablet | Chrome DevTools (320px–1024px)             | All elements visible; no `overflow: hidden` masking critical content.                   |\n| Font scaling works (no clipping)      | Firefox Responsive Design Mode             | Text remains legible; no `em`/`rem` unit conflicts.                                      |\n| Touch targets ≥ 48x48px              | WCAG 2.1 Validator (BrowserStack)         | Manual tap testing confirms no precision issues.                                        |\n| Single-column layouts on mobile       | Chrome DevTools (320px–480px)             | No horizontal scroll; grids/tables stack vertically.                                  |\n| WooCommerce cart/checkout flows       | BrowserStack (real devices)                 | All buttons/inputs functional; no misaligned labels.                                  |\n| Dynamic content (sliders, tabs)     | Console.log + manual interaction           | No JS errors; content reflows correctly on resize.                                     |\n\n### **3.2. Cross-Browser & Device Testing**\n- **Test on:**\n  - **Mobile:** iPhone SE (iOS 15+), Samsung Galaxy S21 (Android 11+), Pixel 5.\n  - **Tablet:** iPad Mini (iOS 15+), iPad Pro 12.9 (iOS 16+), Samsung Tab S7.\n  - **Browsers:** Safari (latest), Chrome for Android (latest), Firefox for Android.\n- **Automated Checks:**\n  - Run **Lighthouse CI** with `responsive` preset (score ≥ 90).\n  - Validate **no console errors** during mobile emulation.\n\n### **3.3. Performance Regression**\n- **Test:**\n  - **Page Load Time:** Ensure no >10% increase on mobile (use `WebPageTest`).\n  - **CSS/JS Bloat:** Confirm responsive media queries don’t add excessive unused rules (`Chrome Coverage Tool`).\n  - **Server Logs:** Check Nginx/Apache logs for `404` or `500` errors post-deploy.\n\n### **3.4. Edge Cases**\n- **Test:**\n  - **Orientation Changes:** Rotate device between portrait/landscape; verify no layout jumps.\n  - **Custom User Agents:** Force mobile/tablet UA in DevTools; check for inconsistencies.\n  - **Payment Gateway Simulators:** Test `Stripe`, `PayPal`, or `Square` mobile flows (if applicable).\n\n---\n\n## **4. POTENTIAL PITFALLS**\n### **4.1. Caching Conflicts**\n- **Risk:** Stale CSS/JS caches may delay perceived fixes.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - **Hard Refresh:** Use `Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R` during testing.\n  - **Cache Plugins:** Disable `WP Rocket`, `W3 Total Cache`, or `Autoptimize` temporarily.\n  - **Nginx/Apache:** Clear browser cache headers or restart web server:\n    ```bash\n    sudo systemctl restart nginx  # or apache2\n    ```\n\n### **4.2. Third-Party CSS/JS Overrides**\n- **Risk:** Payment gateways (e.g., `Stripe.js`), analytics (`Google Tag Manager`), or ad networks may inject non-responsive styles.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - **Inspect Overrides:** Use `Chrome DevTools > Sources > Overrides` to identify external scripts.\n  - **Isolate Custom Rules:** Scope fixes to `!important` only if necessary (document rationale).\n  - **Test Integrations:** Re-run payment gateway/analytics tests post-deploy to ensure no breakage.\n\n### **4.3. WooCommerce Template Inheritance Issues**\n- **Risk:** Directly modifying WooCommerce core files (e.g., `archive-product.php`) may break updates.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - **Child Theme Overrides:** Always copy templates to `/wp-content/child-theme/` before editing.\n  - **Hooks & Filters:** Prefer `add_filter()`/`add_action()` for CSS/JS changes (e.g., `woocommerce_product_grid_columns`).\n  - **Version Pinning:** If using custom plugins, pin WooCommerce version in `composer.json` or `wp-config.php`.\n\n### **4.4. Browser-Specific Quirks**\n- **Risk:** Safari’s `viewport` handling or Android’s `font-size` scaling may differ from Chrome.\n- **Mitigation:**\n  - **Vendor Prefixes:** Add `-webkit-` prefixes for `flexbox`/`grid` if needed.\n  - **Safari-Specific Fixes:** Test with `Safari Technology Preview` for early detection.\n  - **Example Safari Workaround:**\n    ```css\n    @media (max-width: 768px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {\n      /* iPad Pro Retina-specific adjustments */\n      .product-image { width: 50vw; }\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n```"
